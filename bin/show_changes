#!/bin/bash

# Usage:
#	# cd path/to/multilib/overlay
#	# bin/show_changes path/to/file.ebuild
# <read output, use vim to edit the ebuild>
#	# bin/show_changes --check
# <check you changed it correctly>
#	# ebuild path/to/file.ebuild digest	# or repoman manifest
#	# egencache --repo=multilib --update

# The purpose of this script is to display updates to ebuilds in the portage
# tree that need to be ported over to the ebuilds in the overlay, so that you
# can bring them up to date.

# It does this by comparing the CVS revision in the overlay ebuild with the
# current one in your portage tree CVS checkout.

# Possible future directions for this script could involve generating a diff of
# the old revision and the overlay file and trying to apply it to the new
# revision.  At the moment it is manual.

# Another obvious possibility would be scanning for changes in the portage tree
# for everything in the overlay.  This has some large problems: it is difficult
# to know when a particular file was taken out of portage, and so determine how
# far back to check for changes.  This is easy for ebuilds and eclasses, with
# their CVS headers, but for other files this is hugely problematic.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: You will need an actual CVS checkout of the portage tree,
# which you'll need to update before running this script.  You can set the
# following env var to where yours is.
